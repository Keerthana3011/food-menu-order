Online Food ordering system is a process in which one can order various foods and beverages from some local restaurant and hotels through the use of internet, just by sitting at home or any place. And the order is delivered to the told location.

The Online Food Order System In PHP is a simple project developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project connects different restaurants with customers. The project contains an admin(manager) and the user side. All the management like editing site contents, updating food items, adding restaurants, and checking order status can be managed from the admin side. There can be many managers on the site.

For the user section, the users can go through the homepage, about, and contact pages. In order to order the food items, the user has to create an account and sign in or log in. The food comes with the cost as well. This project makes a convenient way for customers to buy/purchase food online, without having to go to the restaurant.
